# Bank - iOS app

This mobile application is the client implementation for a [banking project](https://github.com/ksred/bank).

The banking project aims to build a modern bank fit for consumers using the latest technologies. The mobile application should reflect this, bringing with it a clean, minimalist and beautiful design.

## Functionality
The above project is currently finishing a major overhaul. Once this process is complete, the iOS app will be updated to handle the new HTTP API, along with the extended functionality.

The mobile application will implement all of the functionality fit for a consumer's client, including:

- Accounts creation, updating, deletion
- Payments to peers and merchants
- Transaction viewing
- Budget allocation
- Card services
- Foreign exchange services
- Administrative tasks including fraud prevention, card pausing, etc

## Status
This project is being actively developed alongside the infrastructure. I am actively looking for people to get involved. If are keen, please [get in touch with me](https://ksred.me/page/contact) or submit an issue or pull request.
